        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer

        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing

    n the old days of the Earth,
    humanity lived in peace
    subduing everything before
    them, even the great Titans …
    \n
    Satori, God of enlightment felt his "aloneness" and
    he mated with his own shadow, an eternal darkness
    producing hundreds of Titans.
    \n
    Fire Dinasty is estabilished by the best warrior among titans, the
    Pyromi, which is known also as being the cruelest amongst them.
    Pyromi forced his sister Heathera to marry him
    and enslaved all humans and fire mages.
    He also killed every children that Heathera was about to give birth.
    While Heathera is pregnant with her last son Davion,
    he is growing ten times
    faster than normal due to the miraculous dharma
    that he inherits from his ancestors.
    In an enraged moment, Pyromi approaches Heathera
    with a scythe to kill his last son,
    but Davion senses that and get out from
    inside his mother, took the scythe from his father\'s hands
    and cuts off his head.</string>

    \n
    Seven years later,a triumphant Davion becomes king
    of the Fire Dinasty in 9105-ET,
    frees all fire mages and swear to protect humans.
    \n
    People of Fire Dinasty are seekers of the truth but are also
    eager for growing in power, so in order to achieve this
    their quest is to
    search for their true maker … the god above Satori.
    \n
    For now they only know that their creator is Satori,
    but they are not satisfied with this since Satori could
    not offer to them more power.
    \n
    Titans, the divine beings, unleashed war and chaos on earth,
    so Fire Mages, people of the Fire Dinasty
    turned against their creators to restore
    order and peace for humans.
    In the beginnings of the war, Titans killed almost all
    Fire Mages, but when Davion saw all of this happenings,
    he entered in enraged mode and transformed himself
    into a Dragon!
    </string>
    <string name="prologue_part2b">\n
    This is his first and the last time when Davion is able to
    transforms himself
    into a dragon.
    Eventually Davion and his Dinasty prevailed and
    defeated most of the Titans.

    The result conflict is known as Pyromachy and marks the
    ending of Titans Era and the beginning of a new era.</string>

Satori, God of enlightment is thinking that he has failed to
humans because of Pyromi and
decides to give humanity a gift
in order to regain their popularity,
his son, Augustus, which created the Awakening Portal,
and shortly after, he became the Emperor of the Satoric Empire.
But humans worship Davion now and they are not considering
Augustus to be worthy of worshiping yet.
\n\n
Awakening Portal is not a nice place though, some
of the portal effect\'s are: to turn into a black hole
only for the person that watches into the portal,
if it senses negative dharma, the other effect of the portal
offers the chance to travel through the universe with the body and the mind,
but the traveler will have the body in two places, in portal and where he decides to travel.
Till now only one being survived in the portal, a fire mage named Davion.
    \n\n</string>
    <string name="prologue_part4">
    Davion helped in the beginnings, the blacksmiths to forge
swords enchanted by the wild fire from the
Aldebaran - the giant star located 65 light years away
in the constellation of Taurus.
He managed to get the fire from the star
while they being present in the Awakening Portal,
meditating and transform
himself into pure fire, altough hundreds of Fire Mages
tried to travel in the awakening portal before him, but
all of them died in their own blackholes.
\n\n
Unfortunately, Fire Mages along with Davion slowly forgot
their maker (Satori) as their pride led to evil desires,
So they turned into beings driven by hunger of power
as they assasinated their great Emperor Augustus in 63-AT,
When Humans saw all of this, they turn their faith
to their creator Satori.
\n\n</string>
    <string name="prologue_part5">
    As the sons of Satori, the fire mages increased
in wickedness, the Humans stood
against them with great faith in their creator,
but only a few managed to survive in the
great confrontation shortly after Augustus\'s death,
as Humans are weaker than the fire mages.
\n\n
Stories turned to legend as one unique sword to
believed to be an eternal light grow into infamy.
Said to be forged by the hand of God Satori
himself, many believed that
it gave the wielder great victories and a chance for
immortality, also it could destroy any fire sword made by Davion
but only a few would know the truth …
Davion tried to hold the Satori\'s sword but his hand was evaporated.
\n</string>
    <string name="prologue_part6">Since Davion is not worthy to wield Satori\'s sword
any humans believed that the chosen one for the swords
could have been Augustus, gossips
about Augustus being brought back to life are circulating but
nobody knows the truth …
\n
</string><string name="prologue_part6b">As Davion the fire mage, lost his right hand, he starts to train
his left hand to wield a sword.
Meanwhile between humans, there is a true believer
of Satori that regained many favors from the God
through meditation.
He thinks that he can resurrect Augustus by
going back in the time. Awakening portal
can help him to do this but he can also lose
his life trying to do so.</string>
    <string name="prologue_part6c">He is known by the name of Taozen, the only
human can resist and stay near the awakening Portal
and not die unlike other humans. Altough he thinks
that is not ready to step into the portal yet.
His dharma is special among humans, he was always
considerated special because during the Pyromachy,
the war against Titans, he fought alongside
firemages and proved himself worthy in battle.</string>
