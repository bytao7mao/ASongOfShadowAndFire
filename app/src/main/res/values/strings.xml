    n the old days of the Earth,
    humanity lived in peace, preaching their creator Satori and
    achieving to subdue everything before
    them, even the great Titans …
    \n
    Satori, God of enlightment felt his "aloneness" and
    he mated with his own shadow, an eternal darkness
    producing hundreds of Titans.
    \n
    Now, 5000 years has passed till then.
    It is the year 9003-ET, in the era of Titans,
    fire Dinasty is estabilished by the best warrior among titans, the
    Pyromi, which is known also as being the cruelest amongst them.
    Pyromi forced his sister Heathera to marry him
    and enslaved all humans and fire mages.
    He also killed every children that Heathera was about to give birth.
    While Heathera is pregnant with her last son Davion,
    he is growing ten times
    faster than normal due to the miraculous dharma
    that he inherits from his ancestors.
    In an enraged moment, Pyromi approaches Heathera
    with a scythe to kill his last son,
    but Davion senses that and get out from
    inside his mother, took the scythe from his father\'s hands
    and cuts off his head.
    Rumors are spreading between citizens of fire Dinasty that
    Davion has been drinking dragon's blood to celebrate his father's death. </string>
<string name="prologue_part2">
\n
Seven years later,a triumphant Davion becomes king
of the Fire Dinasty in 9105-ET,
frees all fire mages and swear to protect humans.
\n
People of Fire Dinasty are seekers of the truth but are also
eager for growing in power, so in order to achieve this
their quest is to
search for their true maker … the god above Satori,
which nobody knows who is.
\n
For now they only know that their creator is Satori,
but they are not satisfied with this since Satori could
not offer to them more power.
\n
Titans, the divine beings, unleashed war and chaos on earth,
so Fire Mages, people of the Fire Dinasty
turned against their creators to restore
order and peace for humans.
In the beginnings of the war, Titans killed almost all
Fire Mages, but when Davion saw all of this happenings,
he entered in enraged mode and transformed himself
into a Dragon!
\nn
    When Davion turned into a dragon and flied above the battlefield,
    day turned into night, as his shadow covered the light of the sun 
    to shine over them.
    Now only the dragon's fire attacks would bring light to the 
    battlefield but also death upon them.
    The war lasted eighteen years but Davion triumphed in the end.
    He entitled himself as the king of titans, humans and fire mages,
but he banished his race the remaining titans from the fire Dinasty and Satoric Empire,
and restored order and peace between them, for now.
After he turned into normal form he was not the same anymore ...
he become changed, he depicted an uncontrolable rage,
became unreasonable,lost his calm, wisdom but his strength remained the same.

</string>
<string name="prologue_part2b">\n
This is his first and the last time when Davion is able to
transforms himself
into a dragon.
Eventually Davion and his Dinasty prevailed and
defeated most of the Titans.
\n
The result conflict is known as Pyromachy and marks the
ending of Titans Era and the beginning of a new era.</string>
<string name="prologue_part3">
\n\n
Satori, God of enlightment is thinking that he has failed to
humans because of Pyromi and
decides to give humanity a gift
in order to regain their popularity,
his son, Augustus, which created the Awakening Portal,
and shortly after, he became the Emperor of the Satoric Empire.
But humans worship Davion now and they are not considering
Augustus to be worthy of worshiping yet.
Still, Augustus is considered being due to Satori,
but also proved himself by healing several ill humans,
and resurection of a few.
\n\n
Awakening Portal is not a nice place though, some
of the portal effect\'s are: to turn into a black hole
only for the person that watches into the portal,
if it senses negative dharma, the other effect of the portal
offers the chance to travel through the universe with the body and the mind,
but the traveler will have the body in two places, in portal and where he decides to travel.
Till now only one being survived in the portal, a fire mage named Davion.
\n\n</string>
<string name="prologue_part4">
Davion helped in the beginnings, the blacksmiths to forge
swords enchanted by the wild fire from the
Aldebaran - the giant star located 65 light years away
in the constellation of Taurus.
He managed to get the fire from the star
while they being present in the Awakening Portal,
meditating and transform
himself into pure fire, altough hundreds of Fire Mages
tried to travel in the awakening portal before him, but
all of them died in their own blackholes.
\n\n
Unfortunately, Fire Mages along with Davion slowly forgot
their maker (Satori) as their pride led to evil desires,
So they turned into beings driven by hunger of power
as they assasinated their great Emperor Augustus in 63-AT,
When Humans saw all of this, they turn their faith
to their creator Satori.
\n\n</string>
<string name="prologue_part5">
Davion fear that he could resurect his father, Pyromi
so he make plans with the most powerful between
fire mages to assasinate Augustus in order
to prevent this to happen, this demonstrates that
Davion has still some reason kept in him.
As the sons of Satori, the fire mages increased
in wickedness, the Humans stood
against them with great faith in their creator and Augustus,
but only a few managed to survive in the
great confrontation shortly after Augustus\'s death,
as Humans are weaker than the fire mages.
\n\n
Stories turned to legend as one unique sword to
believed to be an eternal light grow into infamy.
Said to be forged by the hand of God Satori
himself, many believed that
it gave the wielder great victories and a chance for
immortality, also it could destroy any fire sword made by Davion
but only a few would know the truth …
Davion tried to hold the Satori\'s sword but his hand was evaporated.
\n</string>
<string name="prologue_part6">Since Davion is not worthy to wield Satori\'s sword
any humans believed that the chosen one for the swords
could have been Augustus, gossips
about Augustus being brought back to life are circulating but
nobody knows the truth …
\n
</string><string name="prologue_part6b">As Davion the fire mage, lost his right hand,
he starts to train his left hand to manipulate flames in the shape of a sword.
Meanwhile between humans, there is a true believer
of Satori that regained many favors from the God
through meditation, but people are seeing him
only at night and there are believers that he
could be a vampire because he is 300 years old
and still looks young, he is known by the name of Taozen,
long white hair, very calm and patient,

Davion travels with a boat to search for a sword trainer,
he stops on an island full of fog and cold, the island
looks like it is from another planet, but he decides anyway
to continue to search further for a master in the art of swords,
but on his way Taozen stops him with the following words.
"You, i saw you in my dreams, you are the slayer of your own destiny ..."
His eyes are grey, startingly dark in such pale face.
Davion stopped for a few seconds to think about what Taozen said to him,
but Davion is thinking that he is ill and decides to ignore him.
His pupils were pinpoints, burning black and they reached right into Davion and
weighted the soul inside him. The gray around them seemed alive
moving, like fog on the river on a dark night, when the trees vanish
and the lights vanish and there is nothing in the world but his boat and
the river and the fog.

Altough Davion being in a rush and also driven by his mad ego and
ignores Taozen with the following words. "I don't have time to help beggars...",
and push him away, but Taozen
respond shortly. "We shall meet again, and then you will be awoke from this dream",
but Davion chose to ignore him again and continue his quest to find the sword trainer.

Taozen thinks that he can resurrect Augustus by
going back in the time. Awakening portal
can help him to do this but he can also lose
his life trying to do so.</string>
<string name="prologue_part6c">Taozen, is the only
human can resist and stay near the awakening Portal
and not die unlike other humans. Altough he thinks
that is not ready to step into the portal yet.
His dharma is special among humans, he was always
considerated special because during the Pyromachy,
the war against Titans, he fought alongside
firemages and proved himself worthy in battle.</string>
